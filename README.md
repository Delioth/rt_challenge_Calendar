This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is the Calendar portion of a technical interview code challenge for Review Trackers, by Braden Menke.

The source code for this project is found in the src directory, with the webpage serving it located in public/index.html

The Calendar is designed to be as intuitive as possible. To open any day's appointment scheduler, click the "+" button contained in that day. To close that appointment scheduler, click the "x" button that appears. Select a start and end time and click the "Reserve" button to reserve that time for an appointment. To change the start or end time for an appointment, click on the start or end time you'd like to change and select a new time from the dropdown.

Appointments may be made for today or any day later this month.

The calendar will resize horizontally to the size of the browser window, though the interfaces and text may not look good at sizes smaller than 700 pixels wide.

The page containing the React Calendar App is hosted at  [https://delioth.github.io/rt_challenge_Calendar/](https://delioth.github.io/rt_challenge_Calendar/). The built code can also be viewed from the "built" branch. It's possible to install the app from source using `npm install`. You may then build the app by running `npm run build`, or start a local server to host the app by running `npm start` in the project directory.

The other portion of this code challenge is a simple React set of Rectangles, and can be found at [https://github.com/Delioth/rt_challenge_Rectangle](https://github.com/Delioth/rt_challenge_Rectangle), and is deployed at [https://delioth.github.io/rt_challenge_Rectangle/](https://delioth.github.io/rt_challenge_Rectangle/).
